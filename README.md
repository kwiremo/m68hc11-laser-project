The project is about the assembly language code that uses a laser.
For this project, the system toggles between four modes to display characters inputted from a keyboard.  Mode 1 put characters on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) but also the LCD always display characters upon an interrupt, mode 2 put characters on the LCD display and through a laser to display, mode 3 outputted a test signal through the laser (a box with an “x” through it), and mode 4 displayed a spiral animation through the laser.
